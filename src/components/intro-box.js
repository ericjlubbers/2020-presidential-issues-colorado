In their responses, neither campaign addressed every issue covered below. </p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has shaped the campaign in more ways than one, and on that issue Trump’s and Biden’s views are predictably divergent. In the early days of the pandemic, Trump sought to delegate to the states much of the responsibility for responding to the crisis. Biden has repeatedly criticized Trump for the way he has handled the virus, and advocates for a greater federal response. </p> <p>Trump’s stance on providing economic relief to states has changed throughout the fall, as he called off stimulus negotiations with Congress before shortly restarting them and asking for a more aggressive economic response. On this issue Biden says he believes the federal government should do more to provide economic aid to states and has criticized Republicans in Congress for not passing an aid package. </p> <p>The candidates have strikingly different views on energy and the environment -- issues that are particularly important to Coloradans. Trump has consistently promoted fossil fuels in his rhetoric and his policies. He and his campaign have consistently attacked Biden’s position on fracking. The former vice president says he won’t ban fracking but would like to phase it out over time as part of an aggressive effort to stave off the worst effects of climate change. </p> <p>On healthcare, Biden is less progressive than many in his party and says he supports creating a public option and expanding the Affordable Care Act. Trump and Senate Republicans tried to repeal the legislation, which now provides healthcare to over 20 million Americans, early in the president’s term but were unsuccessful. Trump has not put forward a plan outlining what he would replace Obamacare with. </p> <p><strong>How to use this guide</strong>: Select a topic to compare candidates’ positions, or browse by candidate to see their views on an assortment of issues.</p>
