He says states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act -- as Colorado did -- could move the expansion population to a “premium-free public option” run by the federal government, as long as states continue to pay a share of the cost. It’s not clear whether this would help Colorado.","candidateId":"biden","candidateInfo":"Former Vice President and U.S. Senator","campaignStatus":"active"}}]}},"pageContext":{"questionSlug":"health-insurance"}}
