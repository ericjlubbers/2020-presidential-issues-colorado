In addition, Warren wants to use federal dollars to encourage states to spend more money on education and revamp how they fund schools. One of the goals is to increase teacher salaries and pay for paraprofessionals and other education sector workers. The senator would also ensure classrooms are well-equipped so teachers don’t need to pay out of pocket for supplies.
