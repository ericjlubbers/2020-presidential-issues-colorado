After this trial period, Warren proposes adopting Medicare for All by her third year in office.<br /><br />At the state level, Warren has proposed allowing state single-payer innovation waivers that would allow states to start experimenting with single-payer programs of their own.

In response to Colorado’s current public-option efforts, the candidate suggested the state can apply for a waiver, but didn’t say whether his administration would approve it. Still, he added, he would encourage states to experiment with new approaches “as long as they have strict guardrails to protect patients and health care outcomes.”","candidateId":"bloomberg","candidateInfo":"Former New York Mayor and businessman","candidateMug":"/images/candidate-mugs/bloomberg.jpg"}},{"node":{"id":"3392c693-6fb5-5408-8c88-bc069771c9b1","background":"The Democratic candidates each put forward their own health care plan -- but whether it can win approval in a gridlocked Congress is a question that remains.
