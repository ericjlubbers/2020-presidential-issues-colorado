Instead, Warren is trying to walk a fine line: She favors more BLM resources on the ground in Western states but is worried that it will weaken the agency and cause it to lose key staff. If elected, Warren said she would develop a reorganization plan for the agency to increase its effectiveness and accountability and improve the management of public lands. But she did not offer specifics about how it would work. Warren did pledge to fully fund the agency in her first term and eliminate the infrastructure and maintenance backlog for public lands.","candidateId":"warren","candidateInfo":"U.S. Senator from Massachusetts","candidateMug":"/images/candidate-mugs/warren.jpg"}}]}}}
