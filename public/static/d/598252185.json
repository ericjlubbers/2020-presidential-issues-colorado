If elected, Warren said she would develop a reorganization plan for the agency to increase its effectiveness and accountability and improve the management of public lands.

Warren did pledge to fully fund the agency in her first term and eliminate the infrastructure and maintenance backlog for public lands.","candidateId":"warren","candidateInfo":"U.S. Senator from Massachusetts"}}]}}}
