But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://joebiden.com/healthcare/\">Biden’s health plan</a> does include one provision that could affect Colorado’s public option push. Biden says states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act -- as Colorado did -- could move the expansion population to a “premium-free public option” run by the federal government, as long as states continue to pay a share of the cost. It’s not clear whether this would help Colorado.","candidateId":"biden","candidateInfo":"Former Vice President and U.S. Senator","candidateMug":"/images/candidate-mugs/biden.jpg"}},{"node":{"background":"The Democratic candidates each put forward their own health care plan -- but whether it can win approval in a gridlocked Congress is a question that remains.

He even points to the fact that Colorado “backed away from single-payer proposals after realizing how expensive and difficult they would be to implement” -- a reference to Amendment 69, the failed 2016 ballot measure known as ColoradoCare. In response to Colorado’s current public-option efforts, the candidate suggested the state can apply for a waiver, but didn’t say whether his administration would approve it. Still, he added, he would encourage states to experiment with new approaches “as long as they have strict guardrails to protect patients and health care outcomes.”","candidateId":"bloomberg","candidateInfo":"Former New York Mayor and businessman","candidateMug":"/images/candidate-mugs/bloomberg.jpg"}},{"node":{"background":"The Democratic candidates each put forward their own health care plan -- but whether it can win approval in a gridlocked Congress is a question that remains.

After this trial period, Warren proposes adopting Medicare for All by her third year in office.<br /><br />At the state level, Warren has proposed allowing state single-payer innovation waivers that would allow states to start experimenting with single-payer programs of their own.
