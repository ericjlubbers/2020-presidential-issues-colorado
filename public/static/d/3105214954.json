But the state can’t do it alone. Under a 2003 law authorizing the practice, federal approval is required to import drugs from abroad -- and to date no state has ever received it. President Donald Trump supports doing do, but even if the state received the go-ahead by the end of 2020, the next administration would still play a role in such a program’s implementation. One major hurdle that could demand the next president’s attention: Canadian officials have concerns about the idea, and could unilaterally block drug exports to the U.S. before such a program can get off the ground.","candidateName":"Elizabeth Warren","category":"Health care\n","categorySlug":"health-care","questionLabel":"DRUG IMPORTS","questionSlug":"drug-import\n","questionText":"Do you support
