In terms of agriculture, she wants to reverse mergers that hurt competition and break up large, vertically integrated agribusiness companies. Other tenets of her platform are aimed at rural areas, too. She says her plan to cancel student loan debt will allow people to move to rural areas, rather than force them to move to cities for jobs. Likewise, an investment in renewable energy can help lead to jobs in rural areas. And she wants to pump billions into creating affordable housing in these communities.
