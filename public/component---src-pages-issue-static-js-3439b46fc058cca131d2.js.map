But having a plan and passing it through Congress are two very different things. If the next administration fails to pass its health care initiative, expect states like Colorado to continue to try their hand at state-level programs. Colorado is working on a planned public option that would compete for customers on the private insurance market, while a handful of other states have expressed interest in developing fully government-run, single-payer plans.</p>\n    </article>\n    </div>\n    \n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n{/* END QUESTION */}\n{/* BEGIN ANSWERS */}\n{/* SINGLE ANSWER */}\n<div class=\"columns is-centered box\">\n  <div class=\"column is-1 is-2-tablet is-2-desktop is-1-fullhd\">\n  <figure class=\"image container is-96x96\">\n      <a href=\"/candidate/warren/\"><img class=\"is-rounded\" src={WarrenMug} alt=\"Elizabeth Warren\"/></a>\n    </figure>\n    <p class=\"title is-size-6 toppad has-text-centered\"><a href=\"/candidate/warren/\">Elizabeth Warren</a></p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"column\">\n        <p class=\"title is-size-4-desktop is-size-5-tablet is-size-5-mobile\">Short punchy answer that is about ten words long</p>\n        <p><strong>A: </strong>Steyer did not respond directly to whether his administration would assist state-run plans. But his campaign positions suggest he may be more supportive of a state-level public option like what’s being pushed in Colorado than a state-run single-payer system. At the federal level, he opposes a single-payer system, he said, “because I don’t like the idea of telling Americans who are getting their health care through their employee that they don’t have a choice.” Instead, he’s proposing a public option that would be available to all Americans. He argues that competition from the government will drive down the costs of private insurance, drugs and hospital bills.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"column\">\n        <p>I’m calling for a public option, where you use the power of government to drive down the cost of insurance, drugs, and hospital bills for the American people. One of the reasons I oppose going to a single payer-system is because I don’t like the idea of telling Americans who are getting their health care through their employee that they don’t have a choice. I believe that health care is a right and so I support expanding coverage to all Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n{/* END SINGLE ANSWER */}\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n\n\n\n\n</section>\n</div>\n      \n\n)\n\nexport default CategoryContentStatic;","import React from 'react';\nimport HeadlineBox from '../components/headline-box';\n\nimport Layout from '../components/layout';\nimport Byline from '../components/byline';\n// import IntroBox from '../components/intro-box';\nimport NavbarTop from '../components/navbar-top';\n\nimport CategoryContentStatic from '../components/category-answers-static';\n// import IssueTiles from '../components/issue-tiles'\n// import Share from '../components/share-box';\n// import CandidateCardsLive from '../components/candidate-cards-live';\n\nconst IndexPage = () => <Layout>\n    <NavbarTop/>\n    <HeadlineBox>\n        <Byline />\n    </HeadlineBox>\n    {/* <Share/> */}\n    <CategoryContentStatic />\n    {/* <CandidateCardsLive /> */}\n    </Layout>;\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/warren-9203ba515173a54b730d91f67d4444a8.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
